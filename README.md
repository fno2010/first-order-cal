First-Order Logic Expression Calculator
=======================================

A simple calculator which can convert a first-order logic expression to its CNF
(Conjunctive Normal Form).

I just make it open source for some study purpose.

may not maintain it for the long term.

## Usage

This calculator is written by PLY (Python Lex & Yacc). You need to install it
as the dependency. (It should be the only dependency.)

``` python
pip2 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

And then, you can run it directly or use Python explicitly:

``` python
python2 logicParser.py
```
